Welcome to your new blog! This is a sample post demonstrating the Typst-based blogging system.

= Writing Content

Posts are written in Typst, a modern typesetting system. You can use all of Typst's features:

- *Bold text* and _italic text_
- Lists and nested content
- Mathematical expressions: $integral_0^infinity e^(-x^2) dif x = sqrt(pi)/2$
- Code blocks and more

= Metadata

Each post needs a YAML frontmatter block with:
- `title`: The post title
- `description`: A brief summary for feeds and listings
- `published`: The publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
